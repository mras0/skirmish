Website 		: www.followthezombie.com

Other info              : The animation used here is a modified Paul Steed's .bip, Zeke will have a completely different
			  one within the mod as he will most likely be a melee fighter with a sword.
			  Some of the shaders are made using textures already existing in pak1.pk3.(quadmap2.jpg, tinfx2b.tga)
			  We tested the model on P II 400 128MB RAM with riva TNT ( 8 bots 4 of them were Zeke ),
			  and it runs smoothly even with the large amount of .tga used on this model ( mostly for shaders ).
			  Plz forgive us for our poor english as it is not our mothertongue =P
				
			  THANX YOU FOR DOWNLOADING AND ENJOY !
			  

Thanks to               : Rv2K for lending me his microphone =P ( yeah homemade sounds ! )
