Model description       :  Thor was thought to have died on the day of Ragnarok after slaying the midgard serpent                            Jormungand. However the Vadrigar had other plans. They took the God of thunder and left                            his mighty hammer, Mjollnir behind. Thor is forced to use and perfect the strange weapons                           the Arena Masters  put before him, only he is utterly convinced he will be reunited with                           his trusty hammer, someday.
